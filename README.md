# chatbot
Project Summary:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A chatbot or chatterbot is a software application used to conduct an on-line chat
conversation via text or text-to-speech, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live
human agent. A chatbot is a type of software that can help customers by automating
conversations and interact with them through messaging platforms. Designed to
convincingly simulate the way a human would behave as a conversational partner,
chatbot systems typically require continuous tuning and testing, and many in production
remain unable to adequately converse, while none of them can pass the standard Turing
test.The term "ChatterBot" was originally coined by Michael Mauldin (creator of the
first Verbot) in 1994 to describe these conversational programs

Project Purpose:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chatbots boost operational efficiency and bring cost savings to businesses while offering
convenience and added services to internal employees and external customers. They
allow companies to easily resolve many types of customer queries and issues while
reducing the need for human interaction

Project Scope:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The future is not all voice interfaces, but instead it should focus on working within
device capabilities to boost user accessibility and flexibility. Some chatbots can offer
voice-to-text interfaces, voice-to-voice interfaces or text-to-voice interfaces, all
depending on customer need or brand decision.

 Problem Statement:
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“To design chatbot App using Android Based Application Program to reduce human
interaction and interacting with AI machine ”

 Objectives of the Project:
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chatbots boost operational efficiency and bring cost savings to businesses while offering
convenience and added services to internal employees and external customers. They
allow companies to easily resolve many types of customer queries and issues while
reducing the need for human interaction

Organisation of the Project:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The project was organised in a systematic way. First we analysed what are the basic
features to be included in the project to make it acceptable. As it is a android based
oriented project, I made the sketches prior, so as to have an idea like how our output
must look like. After all these, the layouts of various activities was formulated as a
paper work. All the required software were downloaded. Finally, the successful
implementation of the project.
